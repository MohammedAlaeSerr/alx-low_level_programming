Variadic Functions Definition: Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments.

Standard Header: Variadic functions are typically implemented using the <stdarg.h> header, which provides macros and functions to access variadic arguments.

stdarg.h Macros: The key macros defined in <stdarg.h> are va_list, va_start, va_arg, and va_end.

va_list: va_list is a type used to hold information about variable arguments.

va_start: va_start initializes the va_list object to point to the first variadic argument.

va_arg: va_arg retrieves the next argument from the va_list with a specified type.

va_end: va_end cleans up the va_list after all arguments have been processed.

Variadic Function Declaration: Variadic functions are declared with an ellipsis ... in their parameter list.

Example Variadic Function: An example of a variadic function is printf() from the standard C library.

Variable Argument Types: The variable argument types should be known to the function or can be inferred from other arguments.

Argument Access: Variadic functions access their arguments sequentially based on the format specifiers provided.

No Type Checking: Variadic functions do not perform type checking at compile-time for the variadic arguments.

Argument Passing: Variadic arguments are typically passed on the stack.

Prototype Declaration: It's essential to provide a prototype declaration for variadic functions to ensure proper argument promotion.

Function Design: Variadic functions should be designed carefully to handle different numbers and types of arguments gracefully.

Default Arguments: Variadic functions can have default arguments defined for fixed parameters.
